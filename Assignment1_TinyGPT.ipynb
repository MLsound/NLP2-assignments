        "# Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Decoding Strategies:** The implementation of generateV2 successfully demonstrates various text generation strategies: greedy decoding, temperature sampling, and top-k/top-p sampling. Each strategy offers distinct control over the output's diversity and coherence, highlighting the trade-offs between predictability and creativity.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - ***Greedy Decoding*** (temperature=0.0) produced highly repetitive output, as it consistently selects the token with the highest probability, often leading to loops or degenerate text.\n",
        "  - ***Temperature Sampling*** (temperature=0.5, 1.0, 1.5) introduced controlled randomness. Lower temperatures yielded more conservative and predictable text, while higher temperatures increased diversity but could sometimes lead to less coherent output.\n",
        "  - ***Top-k and Top-p Sampling*** provided more sophisticated control over the sampling pool. Top-k limits choices to the k most probable tokens, while Top-p adaptively selects tokens that collectively exceed a cumulative probability p, often resulting in more natural and varied text compared to pure temperature sampling.\n",
        "- **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** Architecture: The integration of a Mixture of Experts layer into the TinyGPT model demonstrated a clear improvement in learning metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The TinyGPT-MoE model achieved significantly lower training and validation losses (e.g., validation loss decreased from approximately 2.06 to 1.87) compared to the baseline TinyGPT model after the same number of training epochs. This suggests that incorporating specialized 'experts' allows the model to learn more efficiently and potentially improves its capacity to model the data.\n",
        "  - The MoE structure enables sparse activation, meaning only a subset of experts are engaged for any given input token. This can lead to models with a large number of parameters (high capacity) but reduced computational cost during inference compared to a dense model of similar capacity.\n",
        "- **Overall Learning:** This assignment provided a practical deep dive into the core components of GPT-like architectures, including attention mechanisms, feed-forward layers, and advanced text generation techniques. Furthermore, it offered hands-on experience in augmenting a transformer architecture with a Mixture of Experts layer, showcasing its potential benefits for model performance and efficiency."
